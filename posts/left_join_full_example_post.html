    <h1>Why LEFT JOIN Needs an 'AND' Clause Instead of a 'WHERE' Clause to Preserve the Left Table</h1>

    <p>In SQL, a <strong>LEFT JOIN</strong> is used to retrieve all records from the left table and the matched records from the right table. When there is no match, <code>NULL</code> values are returned from the right table. A common mistake occurs when users try to apply filtering conditions on the right table using the <strong>WHERE</strong> clause, which can inadvertently change the behavior of the <code>LEFT JOIN</code> into an <code>INNER JOIN</code> by excluding records from the left table.</p>

    <h2>Example with a WHERE Clause</h2>

    <p>Let’s look at an example:</p>

    <pre><code>
SELECT customers.customer_id, customers.customer_name, orders.order_id
FROM customers
LEFT JOIN orders ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id
WHERE orders.status = 'shipped';
    </code></pre>

    <p>In this query, the intention is to return all customers along with their orders that have been shipped. However, using the <code>WHERE</code> clause to filter for shipped orders will exclude any customers who don’t have an order with status 'shipped'. The query now behaves as if we performed an <code>INNER JOIN</code>, removing rows where there is no match in the <code>orders</code> table.</p>

    <h2>The Correct Approach: Using the AND Clause</h2>

    <p>To maintain the desired behavior of the <code>LEFT JOIN</code> and include all customers, regardless of whether they have a shipped order, the filtering condition should be moved to the <code>ON</code> clause like this:</p>

    <pre><code>
SELECT customers.customer_id, customers.customer_name, orders.order_id
FROM customers
LEFT JOIN orders ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id
AND orders.status = 'shipped';
    </code></pre>

    <p>Now, the <code>LEFT JOIN</code> preserves all customers, and the filter on <code>orders.status</code> only applies to the matched rows from the <code>orders</code> table. If a customer doesn’t have a shipped order, the order-related columns will return <code>NULL</code> but the customer will still be included in the result set.</p>

    <h2>Why This Matters</h2>

    <p>The key difference is that the <code>WHERE</code> clause operates on the final result set after the <code>JOIN</code>, while the <code>ON</code> clause controls which rows are included in the join itself. By placing the condition in the <code>ON</code> clause, you ensure that the <code>LEFT JOIN</code> behaves as expected, preserving all rows from the left table while selectively including rows from the right table based on the condition.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>When performing a <code>LEFT JOIN</code>, using the <code>WHERE</code> clause to filter rows from the right table can unintentionally exclude rows from the left table. Instead, placing the filtering condition in the <code>ON</code> clause using an <code>AND</code> condition allows you to keep the full set of rows from the left table while applying the filter to the right table’s rows.</p>
